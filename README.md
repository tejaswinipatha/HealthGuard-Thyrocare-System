## 📘 Abstract

Machine biology at advanced levels is increasingly applied in the health sector, especially for disease prediction. In the early stages of diagnosis, intelligent predictive models are crucial for effective medical screening. This project presents a Medical Information System built with machine learning algorithms, designed to analyze and predict thyroid-related diseases using hospital datasets.

The thyroid gland regulates vital functions like metabolism, and its dysfunction can lead to serious health issues. Our system combines both **parametric** and **non-parametric ML models**, particularly focusing on **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, to provide a reliable prediction of thyroid disorders. It also offers **health suggestions, home remedies, and medication guidance** based on the outcome.
